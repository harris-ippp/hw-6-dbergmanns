<h1>3x1 Program for Migrants in Mexico</h1>

<p>

<header><b><u>Context</b></u></header>
<p>
Mexico is the country with the highest number of immigrants in the United States, accounting for about 28% or 11.7 million of the total number of immigrants in 2013 (Pew Research Center). Moreover, remittances are the second most important source of income for the country, just below oil exports. According to the World Bank, in 2015 remittances represented 2.3% of GDP (26,233 million dollars).
</p>
<p>
In this context, the 3x1 Program for Migrants was founded in response to the need and interest of migrant communities in the United States to support their relatives living in Mexico. Currently, the program is monitored by the Ministry of Social Development and is driven by migrants clubs  to collaborate in actions and social works that contribute to the development of their communities of origin. These organizations act as development players (Orozco and Garcia-Zanello, 2009) and have become a worldwide trend that link migration, remittances, and development (Alarcón and Escala Rabadán, 2007).

<p>
The Program seeks to contribute to the development of localities through funding of community facilities or services, and infrastructure and productive projects. Financial funding consist in joint resources of migrants and federal, state, and municipal governments. The projects are financed in different ways, depending on the project. Usually, the federal government contributes with 25%, migrants with 25%, and states and municipalities with 50%. In other projects, the federal government and migrants contribute with 50% of the resources each. Overall, the Program promotes the coordination of migrant communities and their communities of origin, strengthens the links between these two communities, and enhances the co-responsibility of the different orders of government (Ministry of Social Development or SEDESOL).
</p>
<p>
Migrants choose the localities and projects that receive support. After they choose a project to support, the Committee on Validation and Attention to Migrants decides to accept the project. The Committee is formed by an equal number of representatives from the migrant organizations and the federal, state and municipal governments.

<header><b><u>Types of Support</b></u></header>
<p>
The 3x1 Program for Migrants offers three different types of support:
</p>
<p>
1.	<em>Infrastructure projects</em> which extend access to public services and improve access to big cities on isolated communities. They include drainage, sewerage, electrification; roads, bridges, highways; streets, sidewalks, plazas, parks; projects for environmental sanitations and conservation of natural resources. The maximum federal contribution is one million pesos per project (approximately $53,500 USD dollars), according to a financial combination of 25% by the federal government, 25% by migrants clubs, and 50% by state and municipal governments.
</p>
<p>
2.	<em>Community projects</em> consist on educational scholarships and supports for learning (school supplies, uniforms, and food). Also, these projects include spaces intended for educational, health, sport, or cultural activities. The maximum federal contribution is $53,500 USD dollars per project, according to a financial mix of 25% by the federal government, 25% by migrants clubs, and 50% by state and municipal governments.

The maximum federal contribution is $500,000 pesos per project ($26,750 USD dollars), according to a financial mix of 25% by the federal government, 25% by migrants, and 50% by state and municipal governments. Second, relative projects benefit between two and four families and can be granted a maximum federal amount of $300,000 pesos per project ($16,000 USD dollars). The federal government contributes with 50% and the migrants clubs with the other 50%. However, state and municipal governments can make additional contributions if they have an interest. Finally, single projects can be granted a maximum federal amount of $250,000 pesos per project ($13,400 USD dollars), and the federal government and migrant organizations each contribute with 50%.

<div id="Literature Review">
<header><b><u>Literature Review of the Impact of the Program</b></u></header>
</p>
<p>
The long-lasting impact of a project determines its contribution to the development and sustainability of a locality (Orozco and Garcia-Zanello, 2009). Migrant clubs argue that although infrastructure and community projects promote the development of the locality, they do not contribute to its sustainability. On the contrary, productive projects have a greater economic impact as they can detonate new productive ventures and create jobs (Alarcón and Escala Rabadán, 2007). However, productive projects may have a limited impact in the development of the localities and may imply a loss of productive potential of remittances; they might not increase the number of productive jobs, generate profitable businesses, and thus, promote the sustainability of the locality. Some scholars argue that migrants clubs should not bear the responsibility of creating employment, promoting sustainability, and funding productive projects (Alarcón and Escala Rabadán, 2007). Likewise, other experts argue that productive projects cannot be done without access to basic and functioning public services and infrastructure (Orozco, 2003) so these should receive higher priority.
